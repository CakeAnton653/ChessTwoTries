# ChessTwoTries

*Warning: Please do not consider this feature complete. The implementation for the queen, the knight, and the rook are missing, and parts of bishop's. Additionally, I want to add a proper
package manager, and create a proper arhitecture. Anyhow, I'll try to keep this repo up to date with the current progress.*

A stupid chess engine.

- Why stupid? 

Certain mehanics of chess were not taken into consediration, and also it doesn't exactly account for special cases.

## Other stuff

I might add that this whole thing was written without a reference. No example document, or code was checked in regard to the movement of pieces, or code arhitecture.
I just thought about the movement of the pieces, and tried to implement stuff as I see fit. Enjoy reading/using!
